## Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree

###### Keywords: Keras, Deep Learning, Convolutional Neural Networks 
Architected and trained a deep neural network to drive a car in a simulator that mimics my own driving behavior on same track. 
- Data set is collected from a simulator that consists of center camera image and steering angle.
- A convolutional neural network is trained on these images, executed in Keras, to predict steering angle from the image.
- Trained model is used to drive car in the simulator.
- Here is [detailed project writeup](https://github.com/suji0131/Behavioral_Cloning/blob/master/writeup.md) and [final output video](https://github.com/suji0131/Behavioral_Cloning/blob/master/video.mp4).
